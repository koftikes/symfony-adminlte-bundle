AdminLTEBundle
==============

AdminLTE Bundle based on the AdminLTE Template for easy integration into Symfony.
This bundle integrates several commonly used JavaScripts and Font-Awesome.

## Installation

Installation using composer is really easy:
Configure components directory in `composer.json`:

```json
"config": {
    "bin-dir": "bin",
    "component-dir": "web/components",
    "component-baseurl": "/components"
},
```

After that run the next composer command to download and add bundle `sbs/symfony-adminlte-bundle` to your composer.json:

    composer require sbs/symfony-adminlte-bundle

## Configurations

Enable the bundle in your kernel:

```php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php
public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new SbS\AdminLTEBundle\SbSAdminLTEBundle(),
        new AppBundle\AppBundle(),
    );
}
```

Configure composer.json to install AdminLTE assets into bundle public directory.

_Notice: insert line before `Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installAssets`_

```json
"scripts": {
    "symfony-scripts": [
        "SbS\\AdminLTEBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::buildAssets",
        "Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installAssets",
    ],
    "post-install-cmd": [
        "@symfony-scripts"
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "@symfony-scripts"
    ]
},
```

### Notice for Symfony 2.8 and higher

_Notice: This bundle requires assetic, but it isn't shipped with Symfony anymore since version 2.8._

Assetic will be installed as require bundle and you should enable bundle in your kernel:

```php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php
public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new Symfony\Bundle\AsseticBundle\AsseticBundle(),
        new SbS\AdminLTEBundle\SbSAdminLTEBundle(),
    );
}
```

Add the following lines at `app/config/config.yml`:

    # Assetic Configuration
    assetic:
        debug: "%kernel.debug%"
        use_controller: "%kernel.debug%"
        filters:
            cssrewrite: ~

And following lines at `app/config/config_dev.yml`:

    # Assetic Configuration
    assetic:
        use_controller: false


Install Assets and Dump Assetic. Run the following two commands:

_For Symfony 2.8.\*_

    php ./app/console assets:install
    php ./app/console assetic:dump

_For Symfony 3.\*.\*_

    php ./bin/console assets:install
    php ./bin/console assetic:dump


### Changing default values template

If you want to change any default value as for example `skin` all you need to do is define the same at `app/config/config.yml` under `[twig]` section.
See example below:

    # Twig Configuration
    twig:
        # ...
        globals:
            admin_lte_skin: skin-blue
        # ...

You could also define those values at `app/config/parameters.yml`:

    app.skin: skin-blue

and then use as follow in `app/config/config.yml`:

    # Twig Configuration
    twig:
        # ...
        globals:
            admin_lte_skin: "%app.skin%"

AdminLTE skins are: skin-blue (default for this bundle), skin-blue-light, skin-yellow, skin-yellow-light, skin-green, skin-green-light, skin-purple, skin-purple-light, skin-red, skin-red-light, skin-black and skin-black-light.
If you want to know more then go ahead and check docs for AdminLTE [here][1].

There are a few values you could change for sure without need to touch anything at bundle, just take a look under `Resources/views`.

That's all. Enjoy.
